  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting mental health, but
              it is not clear how people with different types of mental health
              problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of
              cases hit. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to leverage
              natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing
              changes in 15 of the world's largest mental health support groups
              (eg, r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the
              website Reddit, along with 11 non-mental health groups (eg,
              r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the
              pandemic. METHODS: We created and released the Reddit Mental
              Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from
              2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyzed trends from 90
              text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal
              pronouns, and semantic categories. Using supervised machine
              learning, we classified posts into their respective support
              groups and interpreted important features to understand how
              different problems manifest in language. We applied unsupervised
              methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to
              uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the
              pandemic. RESULTS: We found that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed
              spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately
              2 months before other support groups started posting about the
              pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased
              during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories
              ``economic stress,'' ``isolation,'' and ``home,'' while others
              such as ``motion'' significantly decreased. We found that support
              groups related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
              eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic
              change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups.
              Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through
              independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning
              analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of
              a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment
              of history; we discovered that the more users posted about
              COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the
              mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety
              ($\rho$=-0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we found
              the suicidality and loneliness clusters more than doubled in the
              number of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support
              groups for borderline personality disorder and posttraumatic
              stress disorder became significantly associated with the
              suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding self-harm
              and entertainment emerged. CONCLUSIONS: By using a broad set of
              NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of prepandemic posts, we
              uncovered patterns of how specific mental health problems
              manifest in language, identified at-risk users, and revealed the
              distribution of concerns across Reddit, which could help provide
              better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrated
              that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health
              complaints as they appear in real time, identifying vulnerable
              groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have
              utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing
              events such as elections and protests.",
